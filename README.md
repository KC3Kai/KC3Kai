## Disadvantages and their solutions

#### I don't want to play in a Chrome tab
* You can add KC3改 to your desktop or taskbar and play outside of a Chrome tab. [See screenshot here on how it looks like](http://imgur.com/a/nPA12). To do this, follow the instructions below:
  * Click on your preferred play method from gold heart menu
  * While in the KC3改 tab, the page with instructions...
  * Click Chrome menu ( the one that looks like 3 dots on top-right of Chrome)
  * More tools > _opens submenu_
  * Click on _Add to desktop..._
  * Make sure, _Opens as new window_ is checked, then confirm
  * Find the shortcut on your desktop, double-click it
  * (Optional) Drag to taskbar to pin it to taskbar as well

#### Chrome is slow
* If you haven't tried the recent Chrome releases, they are becoming faster/efficient bit by bit every version.
* Some people use other Chromium-based browsers to install KC3改. These include the [original Chromium](https://chromium.woolyss.com/), [Coc Coc](https://coccoc.com/en), [Opera](http://www.opera.com/download), [YaBrowser](https://browser.yandex.com/desktop/main/).

#### I don't like KC3改's interface
* It is no secret that there are some people who think KC3改's interface is, _ugly_, we always try to make things customizable. Since then we have added many confguraton options including:
  * Ability to set background image around the game screen
  * Ability to set background image in information panel
  * Ability to set panel background opacity
  * Added themes to Strategy Room (dark theme)
* Furthermore, we have more amazing things _planned for the future_ such as the ability to fully customize your layout via drag-drop information boxes, color pickers, etc.
