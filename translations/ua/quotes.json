        "46": "Admiral, it's 1600 already. It's already dusk... Say, does that mean there's night battle tonight? Sendai's gonna be there, right?",
        "47": "It's 1700 now, admiral. So how's dinner...? Huh, what? You're gonna cook? Yeah, Not a bad idea\u266a",

It seems that the technology of the Japanese carrier, Akagi, was also referenced in my construction. A Japanese fleet, huh. I'm looking forward to it.",
        "2": "Am I to depart? That would be good, yes?",
        "3": "What is it - you seem to be concerned. The flight decks are continually being maintained by myself. There is no need to worry.",

        "42": "1200. Hmm? So this is \"Mamiya\". The menu... has variety. What do you recommend, Admiral? Curry, you say? Okay, I will take it.",

        "29": "Commander...The 17th Destroyer Division, can sortie at any time... Hamakaze and I are ready... right Hamakaze?",
        "28": "Admiral, have you been eating well? If you don't eat and an emergency occurs, you may not survive it. Even surviving is a splendid battle in itself. So, let's go to Mamiya to eat.",
        "24": "Commander, what? This important discussion. Is it about the 17th Destroyer Division's formation? What, it's not? Then is it something about that Hamakaze? It has nothing to do with Hamakaze... I see. Nn... That ring... to me... w-what... eh! U-um...",

        "21": "Darn it. I cannot be stranded in this place. Move, move it!",
        "22": "I can no longer move... but I will not cause trouble for everyone else. I'm sorry Yukikaze... Would you do me one last favor?",
        "30": "The date has changed. I, Isokaze, will be reporting the time for today. What? Are you dissatisfied with it?",

        "34": "0400. It is almost morning. I think I understand what is it that the Commander's so dissatisfied about, but...",
        "35": "0500. But, even if I, Isokaze, is entrusted with matters outside combat. I will give it my best shot.",
        "36": "0600. It is morning. Well then, it's time to make breakfast. What's with that look?",
        "37": "0700. It's all right, Hamakaze told me how to do it. Here, it's done. How is it?",
        "38": "0800. Commander, what's wrong? You have a stomachache? That's no good, it'll hinder your commanding abilities.",
        "39": "0900. Commander, did your stomachache go away? Aren't you lacking daily training?",
        "40": "1000. Good, it is time for practice. The 17th Destroyer Division is ready to set sail anytime.",
        "41": "1100. Leave the lunch to me as well. Tanikaze taught... Ah, why are you running away. Commander!",
        "42": "1200. It's noon. Here are combat rations from Tanikaze. To have rice balls on the sea is something exceptional.",
        "43": "1300. The rice balls were delicious, right? Even though Tanikaze might not like look like it, she's really adept at taking care of others.",
        "44": "1400. Good, it is time for a real sortie. Let's dispatch our main fleet.",
        "45": "1500. Afternoon snacks? No, no, I don't want it. I'll grow an excess bulge if I do.",
        "46": "1600. Commander, let's strike the tough enemy fleet. Of course, we'll pick the line ahead formation. What, diamond formation you say? You don't understand. You don't understand!",
        "47": "1700. Commander, the day is going to end soon. How time flies. Even in a single day.",
        "48": "1800. Commander, the dinn-- Why are you running away? It's all right, Urakaze will be helping me.",
        "49": "1900. I-it took quite sometime but dinner is ready. Commander, how is it?",
        "50": "2000. That savory egg custard, too, is from Urakaze. Ah, that grilled fish is from me, Isokaze. Is it good?",
        "51": "2100. Thank goodness for Urakaze... Cooking is hard.",
        "52": "2200. So it's time. Good, it's time for night battle practice. 17th Destroyer Squadron, everyone gather all around!",
